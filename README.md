# Thammasat University CS102 Assignments
My CS102 course assignment was published for another student to be the solutions on their own assignment.
Every line of code using the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Problem Statements
The problem statement is provided to students who registered for the CS102 course only. You can find the problem statement on [Courses Web](https://courses.cs.tu.ac.th).

### Prerequisites
- **Text Editor** - Your preferred text editor or IDE.
- **C Compiler** - Such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)

If you are using IDE like `Clion`, `DevC++`, or `CodeBlock` you can compile by using compile button in your IDE.
For others, you can use one of the compilers on your operating system to compile using these commands.

```shell
gcc $(pwd)/[Path]
```
- **Path** - A path to the file includes the filename and file extension.
